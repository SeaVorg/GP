Although we are still in highschool, we have experience in programming and developing in many languages and platforms.
This is our first time at event like this, but we are ready and hopefully we can participate.

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. We will focus in using an API to gather data about different problematics we're (as humanity) facing in this moment. We're going to try to do so in a simpler manner, so everyone can read clearly what's going on.

We aim to build an utility that's going to be useful to millions of people every day, it could be used to warn from upcoming danger and even save people's lives.
